If you want the magic buttons to work (1, 2, 3, and home server buttons, as well as the timer swap button) open up your ...tf/cfg/autoexec.cfg file and put the following in it:

{{{
alias JoinBookmark1 "connect 63.215.74.192:27015; password "  //Connects to Ubercharged.net #1
alias JoinBookmark2 "connect 217.163.27.214:27015; password "  //Connects to Ubercharged.net #2
alias JoinBookmark3 "connect ; password "  //Connects to nowhere
alias JoinHomeServer "connect ; password ; rcon_password "  //Put your match server info here

alias ToggleTimers ""
alias ToggleTimersSmall "cl_hud_minmode 1;alias ToggleTimers ToggleTimersBig" 
alias ToggleTimersBig "cl_hud_minmode 0;alias ToggleTimers ToggleTimersSmall"   

ToggleTimersSmall  //Change to ToggleTimersBig if you prefer the large timers
}}}

The point is to make the buttons point to your favorite servers in the easiest way possible so you don't have to dig through a bunch of code in the HUD files.  Thanks to G-Mang for coming up with the idea of aliasing the connect functions in the autoexec.cfg file.  So long as you _do not alter the alias names_ and only *edit the IPs and passwords* to your liking, you should have no issues.
