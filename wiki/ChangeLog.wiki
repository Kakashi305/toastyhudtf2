===Release v2.2===
 * Switched support from 1440x900 (16:10) resolution to 1366x768 (16:9) due to my new laptop. 16:10 aspect ratios can now eat a big one.
 * Increased border thickness on most of the panels so they even HAVE a border on various resolutions.
 * Further fixes to the main menu.
 * Took the MOTD, map info and item find panels from FrankenHUD.
 * New team select menu.
 * New class select menu (based off the one on FrankenHUD, made 10x better).
 * Added the map name to the scoreboard because I was reminded to :X.
 * Lopped off the "time left" portion of the server time on the scoreboard. Chances are I messed something up for different resolutions.
 * Something else I might have forgotten. Shout if you spot it.

====Release v2.12====
 * Multiple changes to the main menu including adding several "magic buttons" to it (thanks again G-Mang), as well as changing the color theme to match the new dark theme TF2 is sporting.  Might stay, might not, just testing it.

 * The "magic buttons" in the "Find Server" button bar do as listed:
  * The 1, 2, and 3 buttons connect to your favorite servers.  See [http://code.google.com/p/toastyhudtf2/wiki/autoexec this page] for information on making these buttons work.
  * The "home" button next to the 1, 2, and 3 buttons does the same thing, but it's reserved for your match server or whatever you feel like.
 * In the lower right clusters are these three new buttons:
  * The first runs "record fix; stop" in order to reload models and animations (NOTE: It *will* stop demos in progress!)
  * The second runs "hud_reloadscheme" to, uh, reload your HUD to fix any bugs with it for when watching STV and such.
  * The third, and final, toggles between cl_hudminmode 0 and 1 to toggle between the small and large timers.  This one requires you to use the code on [http://code.google.com/p/toastyhudtf2/wiki/autoexec this page] as well.

 * Moved the server name in the scoreboard to cut off the "Server:" bit like I did for the time left.

 * Moved the Engineer's new revenge crits counter to the right of the metal count and added the new kill count icon as a background to it.

 * Updated the engineer's building panel to include all of Valve's recent changes.  Much better now.
